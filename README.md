# n-Body Simulation

## About
This is an approximate simulation of `n` celestial bodies in 3D space under the influence of each others' gravitational force. It tries to simulate the unpredictable trajectories of an n-body system. The motion is always chaotic  $\forall n \geq 3$.

Each body has the same mass and starts with 0 velocity, but the following parameters are configurable in code:
1. mass of each body
2. number of bodies
3. initial positions and velocities of bodies
> [!NOTE]
> Configuring initial positions and velocities in the code currently requires some manual effort.

## Demonstration
For a 3 body system:
![3body](https://github.com/shree675/n-body_Simulation/assets/58718144/57f922e5-39c1-4dfa-b7cf-033e7c9d0039)

For a 6 body system:
![6body](https://github.com/shree675/n-body_Simulation/assets/58718144/becb758d-2dd8-4226-8184-7e1fa678dff2)

> [!Caution]
> This simulation is approximate and the performance tends to degrade over time.
